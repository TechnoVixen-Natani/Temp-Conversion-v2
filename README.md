# Temp-Conversion-v2

# About
This program was made in part because of a class in college. There was a simpler version in our coursework that only coverted Celsius to Farenheit and the reverse. I wanted a bit more, so I took it upon myself to make this program.

# Resources
This program is wrote entirely with Python 3

# Usage
Open with command prompt or your favorite IDE, such as Spyder or PyCharm. I prefer Spyder but you can use whatever IDE you want. 
Once you open the program you should be greeted with a welcome message and short instructions on how to use the software. It will explain what each menu selection does. To select an option you simply type the corresponding number. And follow the on screen prompts.

The program itself will give you the value you entered, and each other temperature value based on the the type used in the program, which is Celsius, Farenheit, Rakine, Kelvin.

# Example

Say you want to convert your known Farenheit temperature. You would press the corresponding option, which in this case is option 1. 

Next step you would be prompted to enter your temperature. 
The program will then convert said temperature to Celsius, Rakine and Kelvin.
It will then display each of the values on screen in a fashion as shown below
 The temperature in Celsius is: 64
 The temperature in Kelvin is: 128
 The temperature in Rakine is: 256
 *Note, the above numbers are for examples only and no way reflect actual conversion amounts
